        <h1>this is where you will learn functions</h1>
        <p>functions are very usfull when you are going to use the same peice of code over and over all along you project.
        so istead of just puing a bouch of loops down you can just call a function instead.
        wherever you want to repeat the code just call your function and its there.</p>
